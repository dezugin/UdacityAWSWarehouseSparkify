# Project: Udacity Sparkify Data Warehouse

## Description
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

I was given two datasets in Amazon S3 storage, the Song Dataset and the Log Dataset

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month.

## Files in this project
- IaC.ipynb - Infrastructure as Code jupyter notebook, creates and deletes redshift cluster, as well as tests the data in the tables
- create_tables.py - creates table schemas in redshift database
- etl.py - extracts, transforms and loads files from s3 to staging tables to analytics tables on redshift
- sql_queries.py - queries used in the entire process

## What I Actually did
### Create Table Schemas

    1. Designed schemas for your fact and dimension tables
    2. Wrote a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in sql_queries.py
    3. Completed the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and create these tables
    4. Written SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist.
    5. Launched a redshift cluster and created an IAM role that has read access to S3.
    6. Added redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
    7. Tested by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in your redshift database.

### Build ETL Pipeline

    1. Implemented the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
    2. Implemented the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
    3. Tested by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
    4. Deleted the redshift cluster when finished.
    
## How to use
Create and configure a dwh.cfg file to your amazon specifications, run create_tables.py and then etl.py on the terminal
